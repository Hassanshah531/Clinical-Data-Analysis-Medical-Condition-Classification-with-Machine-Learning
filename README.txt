                         About Dataset
This dataset was used for the Winter 2018 Kaggle University                       
Club Hackathon and is now publicly available.
                            Summary
In this project Data Analysis is perform on Clinical Data 
for Important Information extraction & Medical Condition 
Classification is done by using diffrent Machine Learning 
ALgorithm. 

Here are just a couple ideas as to what you could do 
with the data:

Classification: Can you predict the patient's condition based 
on the review?
Regression: Can you predict the rating of the drug based on 
the review?
Sentiment analysis: What elements of a review make it more 
helpful to others? 
Which patients tend to have more negative reviews? 
Can you determine if a review is positive, neutral, 
or negative?
Data visualizations: What kind of drugs are there? 
What sorts of conditions do these patients have?
